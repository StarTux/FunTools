# FunTools

Custom Tools for Survival Players.  This plugin is intended to maintain the functionality of custom items which belong to a temporary plugin, for example an events plugin which introduced custom items which players may keep.

## Dependencies
- [ItemMarker](https://github.com/StarTux/ItemMarker) to mark items with custom tags.

## Items
- Halloween Candy `"cavetale.id":"halloween"`, the candy from trick or treating during the Halloween event 2018.  It gives one random potion effect from a short list, with a random amplifier from 0 to 2 and duration from 30 to 90 seconds.
